Iâ€™m Ahmadreza Rajabi, a PhD candidate in Computational Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). 
My research focuses on electronic structure theory and materials science, with a special interest in f-block organometallic complexes and heavy-element chemistry. 
With 17 peer-reviewed publications in journals such as *JACS* and *Chemical Science*, I collaborate with leading groups to advance chemical reactivity and material properties. Explore my work, CV, and projects here!

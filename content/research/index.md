My research focuses on computational modeling of chemical systems, including:
- **Drug Discovery**: Predicting binding affinities using supervised learning.
- **Quantum Computing**: Exploring quantum chemistry with the QM9 dataset.
- **Materials Science**: Studying f-block organometallic complexes via KS-DFT and TDDFT.

For example, I use the Schr√∂dinger equation: $$ H\psi = E\psi $$.
